Description: 'Applying OLS and Lasso regressions on Augmento.ai sentiments/topics data (daily values) to identify the topics that have an explanatory value in explaining the differences in the BTC price. Data is transformed to log ratios, such that the formula for the Lasso regression is log(P_t/P_t-1) = log(X_t/X_t-1) + log(X_t/X_t-2), where X denotes the set of explanatory variables (topics and BTC volume as control variable).'
